ðŸš€ Flutter Practice D001! ðŸš€

## Overview

Practice 001:

- You must create a copy in Flutter.
- The widgets must be organized in folders.
- Do not generate an infinite tree of widgets.
- You should research on the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) for possible widgets that we haven't covered in class, such as:
    - [FlutterLogo](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FlutterLogo-class.html)
    - [Icon](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html)
